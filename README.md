This repository contains an ipython notebook for the automatic annotations with bounding boxes for a single moving object in a video. 

## Environment

You can use the environment.yml file to setup your virtual environment.

## Working

The code uses Optical FLow algorithm to track a moving object in a video from a relatively still camera and returns bounding boxes. The bounding boxes along with video frames are then stored in TFrecords format for training.
